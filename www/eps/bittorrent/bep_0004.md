This document describes the known bit allocations and message IDs for
the BitTorrent protocol.  To request a bit allocation contact
editor@bittorrent.org.  Contact the same address if you are aware of
any omissions.

Reserved Bit Allocations
-----

> reserved[0]
> 0x80  Azureus Messaging Protocol
>   
> reserved[2]
> 0x08  BitTorrent Location-aware Protocol (no known implementations)
>   
> reserved[5]
> 0x10  LTEP (Libtorrent Extension Protocol)
> 0x02  Extension Negotiation Protocol
> 0x01  Extension Negotiation Protocol

> reserved[7]
> 0x01  BitTorrent DHT
> 0x02  XBT Peer Exchange 
> 0x04  suggest, haveall, havenone, reject request, and allow fast extensions
> 0x08  NAT Traversal
> 0x10  hybrid torrent legacy to v2 upgrade

There are known collisions::

> reserved[0]
> 0xFF  BitComet Extension Protocol
>   
> reserved[1]
> 0xFF  BitComet Extension Protocol
>   
> reserved[7]
> 0x01  XBT Metadata Exchange (implemented only in XBT)

It is recommended that further extensions use the Extension Protocol
[#BEP-10]_, a.k.a., LibTorrent Extension Protocol (LTEP).  With LTEP,
extension bit collisions become impossible since no new extension bits
are allocated.  With LTEP, message ID collisions also become
impossible because message IDs are allocated on demand at the
beginning of the connection.  Extension *name* collisions become
possible, but the probability is much less likely.
